Here’s a clear and detailed prompt you can give your Replit AI to build your super admin system for Waibuk:

Prompt for Replit AI

> I want you to create a Super Admin system for my Waibuk web app.
This will allow me, as the owner, to manage all accounts (schools, alumni, and viewer accounts) from one place, while keeping it hidden from regular users.

Key Requirements

1. Hidden Access

The super admin dashboard must not be visible to regular users.

It should only be accessible via a hidden URL, for example: /super-admin.

No public button or link should lead to it.



2. Authentication

Add a special super admin login (separate from normal login).

Only accounts with the role "super_admin" in the database should be allowed.

Include optional two-step verification (OTP or email code) if possible.



3. Role System

Add a role field to users: "viewer", "alumni", "school", "super_admin".

Only "super_admin" should access this dashboard.



4. Dashboard Features

View, search, and filter all registered users (viewer, alumni, schools).

Approve or remove schools.

Manage alumni badges (approve, revoke, or ban users if needed).

View application statistics: number of schools, number of alumni, number of yearbook purchases.



5. Security

Ensure super admin routes and APIs are protected by middleware that checks the user’s role.

Log all super admin actions (e.g., "Deleted School X", "Approved Alumni Badge for Y").



6. Optional Future Features

Ability to reset user passwords or disable accounts.

Analytics for system usage.

Frontend

Create a clean, minimal dashboard UI for super admin with:

Sidebar for navigation (Schools, Users, Alumni Badges, Analytics).

Tables with search, filter, and action buttons.

Hidden entry route /super-admin.



Backend

Add middleware that checks if user.role === "super_admin".

Create APIs for:

Fetching all users, schools, and alumni badges.

Updating roles or removing accounts.

Logging actions.




---

Expected Flow

1. I (the super admin) go to /super-admin.


2. I log in with my special credentials.


3. I can now:

View all schools, viewers, and alumni.

Approve or reject schools and alumni badges.

Remove spam accounts if needed.



4. Regular users cannot access or even see this page.
